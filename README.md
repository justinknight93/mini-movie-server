# mini-movie-server

A simple node program that creates a http server for Kodi.
Not a very impressive program but it works. :)

Add whatever you want to the movies folder and (with Node.js installed) run the following commands

```
npm install
npm start
```

Port number and folder name can be changed by editing the .env file.
